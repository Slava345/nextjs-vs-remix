# Next.js vs Remix

We have two applications: **Next.js (v15.1.6)** and **Remix (v2.15.3)**. Both run on React 19. As of February 2025, Remix officially supports React 18, but it can still run with React 19 in a backward compatibility mode. However, it does not use newer React features such as Server Components or Server Actions.
