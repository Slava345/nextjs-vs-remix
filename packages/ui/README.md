# UI Library for ShadCN Components
This repository provides a collection of UI components built with ShadCN.

**Important Guidelines**
- Framework Agnostic: Components must be compatible with any React framework.
- No Next.js or Remix Dependencies: Do not include Next.js or Remix-specific dependencies in package.json.

Ensure all components remain universally usable across different React environments.
